If you have a description of a video or image, please provide that for analysis..  \n\n            Instructions:  \n            1. For each keyword, verify whether the described clue is present in the image. Clearly state which keywords (if any) correspond to observed anomalies.  \n            2. If no anomalies are found, conclude that the image does not show signs of deepfake manipulation.  \n            3. Provide a balanced judgment and explain your reasoning, ensuring not to assume manipulation unless supported by clear evidence.  \n\n            Response Format:  \n            1. Observations: List the observations for each keyword, explicitly noting whether it matches an observed anomaly or not.  \n            2. Conclusion: State whether the image is likely a deepfake (Yes/No).  \n            3. Explanation: Provide a brief explanation, citing specific observations or lack thereof.\n\n            Example Response:  \n            Observations:  \n            - \"Mismatched shadows\": Not observed.  \n            - \"Unnatural facial features\": Slight asymmetry in the eyes.  \n            - \"Smooth skin texture\": Observed on the cheeks.  \n\n            Conclusion: No.  \n\n            Explanation: While some minor anomalies were noted (e.g., asymmetry in the eyes), these are consistent with natural variations in human features and do not strongly indicate manipulation."
