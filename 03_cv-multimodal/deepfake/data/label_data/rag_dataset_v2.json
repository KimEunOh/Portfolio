For each keyword, carefully examine the image and objectively verify whether the described clue is present. Avoid making assumptions and clearly state if no issues are observed.  \n            2. Maintain neutrality in your evaluation and do not assume the presence of manipulation unless there is strong and consistent evidence across multiple clues.  \n            3. If anomalies are observed, provide a factual description without inferring intent or confirming manipulation prematurely.  \n            4. If no clear anomalies are found, highlight natural variations or explain why observed features may align with expected real-world variations.  \n\n            Response Format:  \n            1. Observations: Provide an objective analysis for each keyword, explicitly stating whether the described clue matches observed details or not.  \n            2. Assessment: Summarize whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest manipulation, emphasizing neutrality and avoiding bias.  \n            3. Explanation: Clearly justify your observations and assessment, ensuring a balanced perspective that accounts for both natural variations and anomalies.\n\n            Example Response:  \n            Observations:  \n            - \"Mismatched shadows\": Shadows appear consistent with the lighting source.  \n            - \"Unnatural facial features\": Slight asymmetry observed, but within the range of natural human variation.  \n            - \"Smooth skin texture\": Minor smoothness noted, but could be due to lighting or image compression.  \n\n            Assessment: There is no strong evidence of manipulation in this image.  \n\n            Explanation: While slight irregularities were noted, these can be attributed to natural variations or external factors like lighting and resolution. No significant anomalies were found to indicate deepfake manipulation."
