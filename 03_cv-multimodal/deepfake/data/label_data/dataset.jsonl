Mention specific landmarks that appear suspicious and explain why.\n\n3. **Skin Texture and Tone**:\n   - Analyze the overall harmony of skin texture and tone across the face.\n   - Look for any unusual smoothness, repetitive patterns, blurriness, or irregular tone transitions that might indicate a generated image. Point out areas with irregularities and explain the specific flaws.\n\n4. **Low-level Clues (Detailed Analysis)**:\n   - Examine the following low-level details individually and note any abnormalities:\n     - **Edges and Borders**: Check for any unusual blending or jagged edges around the face and facial features.\n     - **Sharpness and Distortion**: Look for uneven sharpness, distorted areas, or unnatural focus on certain features.\n     - **Color Tone and Contrast**: Analyze if color tones and contrast levels vary unnaturally across the face or between features.\n     - **Layout and Symmetry**: Inspect the overall layout of the face, ensuring symmetry.
