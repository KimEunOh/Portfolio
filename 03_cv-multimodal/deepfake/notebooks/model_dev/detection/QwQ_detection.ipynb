      "\n",
      "- **Observation:** I compared both sides of the face by mirroring one half over the other. There are some minor differences in the eyes and mouth, which could be normal, but they seem slightly more pronounced than usual.\n",

      "#### Gaze and Pupils\n",

      "Next, I'll look at the gaze direction and pupil size. In deepfakes, eyes can be particularly challenging to render naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Observation:** The subject's gaze appears to be looking straight ahead, and the pupils seem to be of equal size. However, upon closer inspection, there's a slight discrepancy in the reflection in the eyes, which might indicate that the lighting isn't entirely consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Suspicion Level:** Moderate\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Unnatural Features\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll also look for any features that seem unnatural or out of place.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Observation:** The nose appears a bit too sharp, and the lips are fuller than what might be expected for this individual. These could be artistic choices, but they're worth noting.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Suspicion Level:** Moderate\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Skin Texture and Tone\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Smoothness and Tone Transitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Skin in deepfakes is often smoother than real human skin, lacking the natural texture and pores.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Observation:** The skin does look unusually smooth, with very few visible pores. There are also some abrupt transitions in skin tone, particularly around the cheeks and forehead.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Suspicion Level:** High\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Face and Neck Tone\n",
